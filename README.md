Used the React + TypeScript + Vite template.


This site was created to share concrete examples and theory from the higher level math I come across. Mathematical maturity at or above the undergraduate level is often assumed. However, it would be nice if people from all audiences somehow benefitted or learned something from here as well.

The examples and theory will be from the different areas I'm interested in, from things I originally got stuck on and from topics I wish to learn more about. Such as stuff from Algebraic/Arithmetic Geometry, Algebraic Number Theory, Complex Geometry, Hodge theory, Relativity, Quantum Field Theory, Among Others. React-KateX is used to render the latex seen throughout the site.

Also using Tailwind for CSS. As of now there isn't a backend, however I'll likely add one as time passes to support more types of content and comments. 

I'll try my best to update this site on a bi-weekly basis.
